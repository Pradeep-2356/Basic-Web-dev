        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in India is 10:3. Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It varies significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender, caste, religion, language, and disability. Education in India faces many challenges and opportunities, such as improving access and quality, reducing disparities and dropouts, increasing enrolment and completion rates, enhancing learning outcomes and employability, strengthening governance and accountability, promoting innovation and technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Transfroming Education in India</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Up until 1976, under the Indian constitution, school education was a state subject; states possessed full jurisdiction over making and implementing education policies. After the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution of India was passed in 1976, education fell under the concurrent list. This allowed the central government to recommend education policies and programmes, even if state governments continued to wield extensive autonomy in implementing these programmes. In a country as large as India, now with 28 states and eight union territories, this has created vast differences between states in terms of their policies, plans, programmes and initiatives relating to school education. Periodically, national policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programmes and policies.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Lets Grow Together</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is a cornerstone of the nation's development, serving as the foundation for economic growth and social progress. Over the years, India has made significant strides in improving access to education, with a particular focus on bridging the gap between urban and rural areas. Government initiatives like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and the Right to Education (RTE) Act have played pivotal roles in ensuring that children from all socio-economic backgrounds have the opportunity to attend school. Furthermore, the introduction of digital education platforms and the integration of technology in classrooms have revolutionized learning, making quality education more accessible than ever before. By prioritizing education, India is not only investing in its youth but also in the future of the nation, fostering a knowledgeable, skilled, and empowered generation ready to tackle global challenges. Let's grow together by supporting educational initiatives that create opportunities for all, and by fostering an environment where learning is valued and celebrated.</p>
